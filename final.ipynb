    "# The Evolution of the 3-Point Shot in the NBA \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In 1980, the National Basketball Association (NBA) introduced the 3-point line. At the time it was not considered significant, however over time we have seen a drastic increase on the reliance of the three pointer, and today is considered an important part of any team's gameplan. Through their dominance in the mid to late 2010s, the Golden State Warriors have been recognized as having revolutionized the game and making the three pointer a must-have attribute. The logic is simple: a three-point shot is worth more than a 2-point shot, so if a team can make enough 3-point shots, this will outweigh the 2-pointers. However, there have been questions raised about the effectiveness of shooting many 3 pointers, and if it truly translates into a winnning strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I will evaluate the increase in three point shots taken since the introduction of the 3-point line, and how/if taking more three-pointers translates into more victories. Some questions that will be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Does making/shooting more 3-pointers translate into more wins? \n",
    "    - How efficient (in terms of shot-making percentage) do you have to be to make a 3-pointer more valuable than a 2-pointer? \n",
    "    - How does the league compare now vs. 40 years ago? More scoring? Do better teams make more 3-pointers? \n",

    "I scraped data for each season since 1980 from [Basketball Reference](basketball-reference.com). Unfortunately, the table there are not static, but fortunately they had an embedded link for the table, which I was able to use to scrape the tables I wanted! The tables were stored by season, so I just gathered each team's total stats for the season and looped through each link to get every season from 1980-2021 total stats for each team. \n",
